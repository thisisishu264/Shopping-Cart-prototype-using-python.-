# Shopping-Cart-prototype-using-python.-
This is a prototype for my next project which is going to simulate an entire shopping systems with multiple items. For now this only has a shopping cart. 
Its made using python and has the following features:
1) Items can be added, deleted and modified.
2) Multiple carts can be created and deleted. 
3) Two shopping carts / lists can be merged.
4) Carts have names and unique idenetity numbers.
5) Cart totals and item totals can be found.

The purpose of the program is to show my growth in OOPs concept over time. Thie program only utilized classes and objects.
